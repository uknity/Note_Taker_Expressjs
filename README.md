## Description

This project utilizes Express.js to allow the client to take notes and to save them.  It utilizes a json database on the back end to store and retrieve notes.  Using GET and POST commands in the API routes allows notes to be read, assigned a unique id, and returned to the json database to be stored.  In addition, when the client deletes a note, it is removed from the json database.

## Installation
